The hands-off, recurring revenue, live-ad platform for local and niche publishers

Replace your banner ad space with useful content your readers actually look forward to... instead of away from.

Banner ads—they typically deliver little value to readers and therefore deliver low revenue to publishers. It’s time to put your most valuable ad space to work. Instead of displaying lower value banner ads that readers ignore, *let your advertisers post relevant promos in real time*, any time of day.

**Publishers**

Can attract many more advertisers to the same banner ad space. Gain 20 times more revenue, and a hands-off recurring revenue stream

**Advertisers**

Can publish promos around-the-clock, publish as often as they like to the top ad spots, and enjoy a stream of new views and clicks

**Readers**

Find and enjoy useful and timely promotions from local and relevant businesses

LiveMarket provides you with an automated recurring revenue stream and your audience with ads that they actually want to see. It’s a win for publishers, advertisers, and readers.
